function new = newGeneration( population, Fit_matrix )
%NEWGENERATION Summary of this function goes here
%   Detailed explanation goes here


% SELECTION
%   - Stochastic
%   - Assign weights to each feature vector
%   - The weight can be determined by dividing fitness by sum of fitness
%   - Pick the top vectors at random (taking into account weights)






% CROSSOVER
%   - From the selected vectors, use crossover to create offspring
%   - I think you have to have two parents to make a crossover
%   - You only make enough offspring to equal the population size

% MUTATION
%   - Use a mutation function to just randomly change a couple offspring


% NEW GENERATION
%   - Once the above stages are complete, the new generation is complete
%   - Output the population
