%NEWGENERATION Summary of this function goes here
%   Detailed explanation goes here


% SELECTION
%   - Stochastic
%   - Assign weights to each feature vector
%   - The weight can be determined by dividing fitness by sum of fitness
%   - Pick the top vectors at random (taking into account weights)

% CROSSOVER
%   - From the selected vectors, use crossover to create offspring
%   - I think you have to have two par
